# Task Manager App

A simple JavaScript task manager that lets users:
- Add tasks with deadlines and categories
- Update task status
- Filter tasks by category or status
- Automatically mark tasks as "Overdue"
- Persist data using localStorage

## How It Works

- Fill in the form to add a task
- Use the filters to find what you're working on
- Tasks stay saved even after refreshing the page!

## Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Local Storage

## Reflection

I learned how to manage dynamic data using arrays, objects, and local storage. The biggest challenge was syncing filters and task rendering, but breaking the logic into small functions helped. If I had more time, Iâ€™d improve the UI and add category color-coding or task priorities.
